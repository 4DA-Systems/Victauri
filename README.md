Testing Tauri apps today means choosing between frontend mocks that lie about your backend, WebDriver setups that take a weekend, or paying for macOS CI runners. Victauri replaces all three: it embeds a lightweight server inside your Tauri process (debug builds only) that gives your test suite, `curl`, and CI direct access to the DOM, IPC layer, Rust backend state, the database, and native windows — from one test, on all three platforms. No WebDriver. No browser dependency. **Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.**

That same server also speaks [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), so any AI agent — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf — can drive and debug your app with the exact same full-stack access. **Testing is the job; the agent integration is the bonus.**

> **Tested against real-world Tauri apps.** In a one-time deep evaluation (May 2026) across 5 open-source apps (Kanri, En Croissant, Surrealist, Duckling, Lettura), **867 / 895 checks passed (96.9%)** with zero Victauri bugs and zero changes to the apps. A **reproducible compat harness** ([`scripts/compat`](scripts/compat)) re-runs an app-agnostic smoke battery against the *current* code **on demand** (and weekly), pinned to three Tauri-2 apps (Kanri, En Croissant, Lettura). It is a best-effort net for upstream drift, not a release gate — third-party apps move on their own schedules and periodically need re-pinning. See the [compat README](scripts/compat/README.md) for what it covers and current per-app status.

> **Note — browser mode removed (2026-06-09).** The experimental `victauri-browser` extension + `@4da/victauri-browser` npm package (MCP for *any website*) have been removed so Victauri can focus on its strength: full-stack introspection *inside* Tauri apps. For browser automation, use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or the Chrome DevTools Protocol. The Tauri plugin is unaffected. Details & migration: [#15](https://github.com/runyourempire/victauri/issues/15).

## What You Get

**For your test suite and CI:**

- **Full-stack verification** — click a button, verify the IPC call, query the database to confirm the write, check the UI updated — in one test
- **Direct backend access** — query SQLite databases, browse app files, read config, inspect process memory — no webview proxy
- **Ghost command detection** — find frontend calls with no backend handler, and backend commands the frontend never calls
- **Cross-boundary state checking** — compare DOM state against Rust backend state and catch the drift between them
- **Time-travel recording** — record interactions, checkpoint state, replay sequences, generate test files
- **Cross-platform, no WebDriver** — identical behavior on macOS, Windows, and Linux; runs headless in CI under `xvfb`
- **Zero runtime cost in release** — the server is gated behind `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`, so `init()` is a no-op and nothing listens in release builds. (The crate still compiles in; add it as a `dev-dependency` if you want it absent from the release binary entirely.)

**Bonus — for AI agents:** the same server speaks MCP, so Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP client get this full-stack access for interactive debugging — no extra setup.

## Will Victauri work on your app?

Victauri is a **build-time dev dependency you add to your own app's source and rebuild** — not a tool you attach to an already-running or shipped app. It works when **all four** hold:

1. **Tauri 2.** Tauri 1.x apps can't host it — their `webkit2gtk-sys 0.18` and Victauri's `2.x` both link the native `web_kit2` library, an unresolvable cargo conflict. (Tauri 2 is the current major; Tauri 1 is legacy.)
2. **Built from source** with the plugin wired in — one line in `Cargo.toml`, `.plugin(victauri_plugin::init())`, and a `victauri:default` capability. There is no inject-into-a-foreign-binary path.
3. **A debug build.** The server is `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`-gated, so `init()` is a no-op and nothing listens in release. It's a dev/test-time tool by design.
4. **Each window grants `victauri:default`.** Tauri's per-window permission ACL silently blinds the bridge without it; the `window introspectability` tool detects and explains this.

**Framework** (React, Vue/Nuxt, Svelte, vanilla) and **OS/webview engine** (WebView2 / WKWebView / WebKitGTK) do **not** matter — all supported and cross-checked on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

| ✅ Works on | ❌ Won't work on |
|---|---|
| Your own Tauri 2 app during development | Tauri 1.x apps |
| Any Tauri 2 app you can build from source (debug) | Release / production builds |
| Any frontend framework, any of the 3 OSes | A binary you didn't build (no source) |
| | Non-Tauri apps (Electron, native, plain web) |

Full details, edge cases, and a tested-apps list: [**Compatibility**](docs/src/compatibility.md).

## Quick Start

### Install the CLI

```bash
cargo install victauri-cli
```

### Set up your project

From your Tauri project root:

```bash
victauri init
```

This will:
- Add `victauri-plugin` and `victauri-test` to your `Cargo.toml`
- Create starter smoke tests in your `tests/` directory
- Print the next steps to wire the plugin

### Wire the plugin

Add one line to your Tauri builder:

```rust
// src-tauri/src/main.rs (or lib.rs)
tauri::Builder::default()
    .plugin(victauri_plugin::init())
    .invoke_handler(tauri::generate_handler![/* your commands */])
    .run(tauri::generate_context!())
    .expect("error while running tauri application");
```

In release builds, `init()` returns a no-op plugin — the server never starts, so there's zero runtime cost and no feature flags needed.

### Run tests

Start your app, then run the smoke suite:

```bash
pnpm tauri dev                                   # start your app
VICTAURI_E2E=1 cargo test --test smoke           # run tests
```

Or use the CLI for instant validation:

```bash
victauri test                                    # 11 built-in smoke checks
victauri check                                   # server health + IPC diagnostics
```

### Connect an AI agent

Add `.mcp.json` to your project root (created automatically by `victauri init`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-app": {
      "command": "victauri",
      "args": ["bridge", "--wait"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `victauri bridge` stdio proxy discovers the running app's port at connect time and
re-discovers on restart, so the agent always reaches the right app — even across rebuilds, or
when several Victauri apps are running (add `"--app", "<your.bundle.identifier>"` to pin one).
Prefer it over a fixed `"url": "http://127.0.0.1:7373/mcp"`, which hardcodes a port and can
bind the wrong app.

Works with **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf**, and any MCP client. Your agent gets full-stack access: DOM snapshots, IPC monitoring, command invocation, screenshot capture, accessibility auditing, and more.

**With Claude Code**, start your app and Claude can immediately:
- Inspect the DOM tree and click/type/fill any element
- Invoke any `#[tauri::command]` and verify the response
- Read app config, list files, query SQLite databases
- Take screenshots and audit accessibility
- Record interactions and replay them as tests

---

## Writing Tests

The `e2e_test!` macro handles server detection and auto-connect:

```rust
use victauri_test::{e2e_test, VictauriClient};

e2e_test!(greet_flow, |client| async move {
    client.fill_by_id("name-input", "World").await.unwrap();
    client.click_by_id("greet-btn").await.unwrap();
    client.expect_text("Hello, World!").await.unwrap();
});
```

### Locator API

For complex queries, composable locators with auto-waiting expectations:

```rust
use victauri_test::prelude::*;

e2e_test!(settings_flow, |client| async move {
    let save = Locator::role("button").and_text("Save");
    let email = Locator::label("Email address");

    email.fill(&mut client, "user@example.com").await.unwrap();
    save.click(&mut client).await.unwrap();

    Locator::test_id("toast-message")
        .expect(&mut client)
        .to_contain_text("Settings saved")
        .await
        .unwrap();
});
```

Locators support `role`, `text`, `test_id`, `css`, `label`, `placeholder`, `alt_text`, and `title` strategies with chainable refinement (`.and_text()`, `.nth()`, `.and_tag()`). See the [Testing Guide](docs/src/testing.md) for the full Locator API reference.

### Direct Client Methods

| Method | What it does |
|---|---|
| `click_by_text("Submit")` | Find element by visible text, click it |
| `click_by_id("save-btn")` | Find element by HTML id, click it |
| `fill_by_id("email", "a@b.com")` | Find input by id, fill value |
| `type_by_id("search", "query")` | Find input by id, type char-by-char |
| `select_by_id("theme", "dark")` | Find select by id, choose option |
| `expect_text("Success!")` | Poll until text appears (5s timeout) |
| `expect_no_text("Error")` | Poll until text disappears (3s timeout) |
| `text_by_id("counter")` | Get text content of element by id |

---

## Full-Stack Verification

This is what sets Victauri apart — verifying that frontend actions actually trigger the right backend logic.

### UI to IPC to Database

```rust
// Click "Save" in the UI
client.click_by_id("save-btn").await?;

// Verify the IPC command was called
let log = client.get_ipc_log(None).await?;
assert_ipc_called(&log, "save_settings");

// Verify the database was actually written
let result = client.query_db(
    "SELECT value FROM settings WHERE key = 'theme'",
    None, None,
).await?;
assert_eq!(result["rows"][0]["value"], "dark");
```

### Fluent Verification

Check multiple conditions at once — DOM, IPC, accessibility, errors — with a single report:

```rust
client.verify()
    .has_text("Settings saved")
    .ipc_was_called("save_settings")
    .no_console_errors()
    .no_ghost_commands()
    .ipc_healthy()
    .coverage_above(80.0)
    .run()
    .await?
    .assert_all_passed();
```

### Ghost Command Detection

Find orphaned commands — called in the frontend but missing from the backend:

```rust
let ghosts = client.detect_ghost_commands().await?;
assert!(ghosts["ghost_commands"].as_array().unwrap().is_empty(),
    "Found ghost commands: {ghosts}");
```

See the [Testing Guide](docs/src/testing.md) for IPC checkpoints, visual regression testing, IPC coverage, accessibility auditing, performance monitoring, time-travel recording, CI integration, and more.

## MCP Tools

35 tools across the full stack — backend, IPC, webview, and introspection:

### Backend tools (direct Rust access, no webview needed)

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `app_info` | App config, directory paths, env vars, discovered databases, process info |
| `list_app_dir` | Browse files in app data/config/log/local_data directories |
| `read_app_file` | Read files from app backend directories (UTF-8 or base64) |
| `query_db` | Read-only SQLite queries with auto-discovery |
| `invoke_command` | Call any Tauri command directly through IPC |
| `app_state` | Read app-defined backend-state probes (pipeline/queue/cache internals) — no IPC round-trip |
| `get_memory_stats` | Real-time OS process memory (working set, page faults) |

### IPC tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `get_registry` | List all `#[inspectable]` command schemas |
| `detect_ghost_commands` | Find orphaned frontend IPC calls with no backend handler |
| `check_ipc_integrity` | Detect stuck/stale/errored IPC calls |
| `verify_state` | Compare frontend DOM against backend state |
| `resolve_command` | Natural language to matching Tauri command |

### Webview tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `eval_js` | Execute JavaScript in the webview |
| `dom_snapshot` | Full accessibility tree with ref handles |
| `find_elements` | Search by text, role, test ID, CSS, label, placeholder, alt, title |
| `screenshot` | Platform-native window capture (no Chromium) |
| `wait_for` | Poll for conditions: text, selector, IPC settle, JS `expression`, or Tauri `event` — await async backend work without sleeps |
| `assert_semantic` | Evaluate JS + assert against expected value |

### Compound tools (multiple actions per tool)

| Tool | Actions |
|---|---|
| **`interact`** | `click`, `double_click`, `hover`, `focus`, `scroll`, `select` |
| **`input`** | `fill`, `type_text`, `press_key` (keyboard combos supported) |
| **`window`** | `get_state`, `list`, `manage`, `resize`, `move`, `set_title` |
| **`storage`** | `get`, `set`, `delete`, `cookies` |
| **`navigate`** | `go_to`, `back`, `history`, `dialogs` |
| **`recording`** | `start`, `stop`, `checkpoint`, `events`, `export`, `import` |
| **`inspect`** | `styles`, `bounds`, `highlight`, `audit_accessibility`, `get_performance` |
| **`logs`** | `console`, `network`, `ipc`, `navigation`, `dialogs`, `events`, `slow_ipc` |
| **`css`** | `inject`, `remove` |
| **`introspect`** | `command_timings`, `coverage`, `contract_record`, `contract_check`, `startup_timing`, `capabilities`, `db_health`, `plugin_state`, `processes`, `plugin_tasks`, `event_bus` |
| **`fault`** | `inject` (delay/error/drop/corrupt), `list`, `clear`, `clear_all` |
| **`explain`** | `summary`, `last_action`, `diff` |
| `get_plugin_info` | Plugin config: port, tools, privacy, version |
| `get_diagnostics` | Shadow DOM, service workers, iframes, large DOM detection |

All tools are also available via REST at `POST /api/tools/{name}` — no MCP client needed. See the [Tools Reference](docs/src/tools-reference.md).

## How It Works

```
AI Agent / cargo test / curl
        |
        v
  HTTP on :7373
  ├── /mcp          (MCP protocol — for AI agents)
  ├── /api/tools    (REST API — for scripts and CI)
  └── /health       (health check — for monitoring)
        |
        v
  Victauri Plugin  (inside Tauri process)
     |       |       |
     v       v       v
  WebView  IPC    Backend
  - DOM    - log   - app config
  - click  - args  - file system
  - eval   - cmds  - SQLite DBs
  - a11y   - ghost - memory
  - perf   - verify- env vars
```

Victauri runs **inside** the Tauri process — same thread pool, same memory space. This isn't an implementation detail; it changes what's possible:

| | Embedded (Victauri) | External process |
|---|---|---|
| **Tool response** | <1ms (function call) | 5-50ms (IPC + serialization) |
| **State accuracy** | Zero drift (reads live state) | Stale (snapshot + transfer) |
| **Backend access** | Full (AppHandle, DB, state) | Limited (webview only) |
| **Setup** | One line in Cargo.toml | Separate process + config |
| **Release build** | `init()` is a no-op (zero runtime cost) | Must be disabled manually |

**Port selection:** Victauri tries port 7373 first, then falls back through 7374-7383 if taken. The actual port is written to a temp directory for automatic client discovery.

## Security

Victauri is designed for development, not production:

- **Debug-only**: the server is `#[cfg(debug_assertions)]`-gated, so `init()` is a no-op and nothing listens in release builds
- **Localhost-only**: binds to 127.0.0.1, DNS rebinding protection
- **Auth on by default**: auto-generated Bearer token, auto-discovered by clients (`.auth_disabled()` to opt out)
- **Rate limited**: 1000 req/sec, token-bucket algorithm
- **Privacy profiles**: `Observe` (read-only), `Test` (interactions), `FullControl` (everything)
- **Output redaction**: auto-scrub API keys, tokens, emails from tool responses

See the [Security Guide](docs/src/security.md) for threat model, privacy configuration, and command filtering.

---

## CI Integration

### GitHub Actions

Use the built-in composite action to run Victauri smoke tests in CI:

```yaml
- name: Build my app
  run: cargo build -p my-app

- name: Start app under xvfb
  run: |
    xvfb-run -a ./target/debug/my-app &
    sleep 3

- uses: runyourempire/victauri/.github/actions/victauri-test@v0.8.1
  with:
    max-load-ms: 10000
    max-heap-mb: 512
```

The action installs `victauri-cli`, waits for the server to become healthy, and runs all 11 smoke checks. Available inputs:

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `port` | `7373` | Victauri server port |
| `max-load-ms` | `10000` | Maximum DOM complete time (ms) |
| `max-heap-mb` | `512` | Maximum JS heap usage (MB) |
| `junit-path` | | Path to write JUnit XML report |
| `coverage` | `false` | Run IPC coverage report after tests |
| `coverage-threshold` | | Minimum coverage % (fails if below) |
| `health-timeout` | `30` | Seconds to wait for server health |

Or use `victauri init` to generate a complete CI workflow file for your project:

```bash
victauri init    # generates .github/workflows/victauri.yml
```

## What It Doesn't Do

- **No production use** — debug builds only, by design
- **No remote access** — localhost only, no port forwarding
- **Same-origin frames only** — same-origin iframes are traversed; cross-origin frames are marked and skipped
- **No live frontend-IPC control** — `fault` injection applies to commands driven through Victauri's own `invoke_command`, not the app's real frontend IPC (that path sits below the layer the JS bridge can reach without CDP)
- **Pre-1.0** — API may change (semver-checked in CI)

## Community & Contributing

Victauri is open source and built by [4DA Systems](https://4da.ai), which uses it to test its own Tauri app. We want it to become the default way to test Tauri apps full-stack — and that needs more than one company.

- **Using it on a Tauri app?** Tell us — open a [discussion](https://github.com/runyourempire/victauri/discussions) or issue. We'd love to add you to a "used by" list and learn what broke.
- **Want to contribute?** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Good first areas: more `victauri-test` assertion helpers, framework-specific testing guides, and CI recipes.
- **Found a bug or a Tauri app it doesn't work on?** File an issue with the app and the failing tool call — those reports are the most valuable thing you can send us.

If Victauri saves you a weekend of WebDriver setup, a ⭐ helps other Tauri developers find it.
